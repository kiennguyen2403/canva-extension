## Inspiration
As non-professional designers, my team and I faced significant challenges in transforming our ideas into tangible sketches. We struggled with:

- ❓ Not knowing where to start
- 🎨 Lacking design criteria
- 📈 Unsure of how to improve our designs
- 🎓 Limited resources, as we are all students

## What It Does
AviMate addresses these challenges by offering:

- 📝 **Real-time review and feedback** based on various design criteria
- ✅ **Final grading and suggestions** for improvement
- 📐 **Personalized design templates and images** that align with the user's ideas

## How We Built It
We developed AviMate using the following technologies:

- 🛠️ **Canva Apps SDK** for seamless communication with the Canva board
- ☁️ **Convex (serverless)** for real-time processing, API management, and data storage
- ⚙️ **Flask**, hosted on Google Cloud VM, for communication with model endpoints and image processing

  - Models utilized:
    - 🖼️ **Roboflow**: One model for detecting errors and another for categorizing poster components
    - 🤖 **Hugging Face Space**: Hosting Stable Diffusion 3 for image generation

## Challenges We Ran Into
Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges:

- 🔄 Ensuring **consistency in suggestions and grading** (the same image should yield identical results regardless of when it’s run)
- 🔗 Integrating various **pieces of technology**
- 🎯 Achieving accuracy in our **extracting and detecting models**
- ⏳ Enhancing the **efficiency of the image-generating model** (both in time and quality)
- 🛠️ Managing the **resource requirements** for deployment and hosting

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
Despite the challenges, we achieved several milestones:

- 🎉 Creating a **complex workflow** that operates harmoniously within strict time constraints
- 📚 Learning new skills, particularly in **training and working with AI models**, as we are all students
- 🔧 Effectively utilizing the provided **SDK** for development

## What We Learned
Our experience taught us:

- 📈 The intricacies of **training and working with AI models**
- 🌟 The potential of **AI to facilitate creative processes** and open new opportunities

## What's Next for AviMate - Define Perfection
We envision the next steps for AviMate as follows:

- 🖌️ Completing the app's flow to mirror how an artist paints a picture: 
  - ✏️ Generating a **draft (prototype)**
  - 🎨 **Drawing details**
  - 🌈 Adding **colors**
- 🔍 Improving our ability to **extract all components** within the details, enhancing user flexibility for making changes (while recognizing current technological limitations)
- 📈 Focusing on **scalability** to ensure the app can effectively serve multiple users simultaneously
- 📊 Supporting **presentation creation** and **logo design** to broaden the app's utility for users in various design contexts
